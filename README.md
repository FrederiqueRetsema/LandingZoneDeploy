# LandingZone Deploy
This program helps you to deploy LandingZone resources to multiple accounts.

Go to the main directory and start the program via:

python .\scripts\landingzone_deploy.py

## Testing
I added quite some tests. I used tox to do the tests: go to the main directory and type:

.\tox

# Disclaimer
You're free to use this program in any way you like. I might or might not maintain the program in the future.
